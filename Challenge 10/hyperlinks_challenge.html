        <h1>My HTML experience</h1>
       
            <font size="5px">

                <p>This is what i have learnt so far about html and how it works as well as what it is used for.</p>

                <p>During this module I have learnt to do almost everything in HTML. I have learnt how to use <em>h1</em> to <em>h6</em> tags for text and to use the <em>p</em> tags to create paragraphs. The ones I really liked is the <em>a</em> tags to create links and I must say using an image as a link was really amazing. The forms was a bit difficult to grasp but after enough practice it became easy and not to mention the nester table challenge which was an absolute headache. I sat with it for such a long time but eventually I figured it out and realized just how easy it was. I learnt how to use radio buttons, submit buttons and link buttons.</p>

                <p>Doing the Challenges was really fun and it really made us use the knowledge that we have gained. Some were easy where as some were very difficult but then again without challenges we will never improve. While learning how to use the tags and the functions I also learnt how to make my codes indentation correctly and make it legible. I have learnt how to import images into my html by using a link or using in image on my local machine. I have learnt how to center my content and how to change the font sizes of my text and even my images.</p>

                <p>I have learnt to use the <em>em</em> tags to make my text italic and to use the strong tag to make my text bold. I have learnt to use the <em>font</em> tag to modify my text. I have learnt how to comment and the structure of the page showing the content like the footer, header etc.</p>

                <p>That is what I have learnt so for and hopefully I will learn more.</p>
