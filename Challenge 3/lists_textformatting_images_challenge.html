          <h2>Instructions</h2>

              <p> In a large pot, bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil. Add the lobster tails and let boil very briefly (1-2 minutes) until pink. Turn the heat off. Remove the lobster tails with a pair of tongs. Do not discard the lobster cooking water. When the lobster is cool enough to handle, remove the shell and cut into large chunks.<p>
              
              <p>In a large deep pan or skillet, heat 3 tbsp olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onions. Saute the onions for 2 minutes then add the rice, and cook for 3 more minutes, stirring regularly. Now add the chopped garlic and the lobster cooking water. Stir in the saffron and it’s soaking liquid, paprika, cayenne pepper, aleppo pepper, and salt. Stir in the chopped tomatoes and green beans. Bring to a boil and let the liquid slightly reduce, then cover (with lid or tightly with foil) and cook on low heat for 20 minutes.<p>
              
              <p>Uncover and spread the shrimp over the rice, pushing it into the rice slightly. Add a little water if needed. Cover and cook for another 10-15 minutes until the shrimp turns pink. Finally, add the cooked lobster chunks. When the lobster is warmed through,turn heat off. Garnish with parsley.<p>
              
              <p>Serve the paella hot with your favorite white wine.<p>

    <!-- Summary of the dish -->
            <h2>Summary</h2>   
              
                <p> Depending on the kind of rice you use, you may or not need to soak it in water before cooking. I have found soaking my rice in water for 15 minutes or so (until you are able to easily break a grain of rice between your thumb and index finger) helps speed the cooking process. When you do this, you naturally use less cooking water.</p>

                <p>I am aware that, in some recipes, you are almost “forbidden” from stirring the rice. But it worked best for me this way. Grateful to Bobby Flay for this tip.</p>
